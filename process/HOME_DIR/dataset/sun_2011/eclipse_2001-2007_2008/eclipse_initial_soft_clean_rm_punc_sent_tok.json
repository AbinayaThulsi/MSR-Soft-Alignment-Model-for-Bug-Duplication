just happened that I haven t yet tried to\n\trelease something without catching up first  so I never noticed that it was possible to do both\n\tat the same time \nIf we are allowing both  then the

wanted to see what he had changed \nThen he decided to catch up\n\tbecause the number of changes was significant \nHe popped up the context menu on the root of\n\tthe changes tree  and hovered over the  Release  item  and  since I had just released a ton of\n\tchanges that I did not want overwritten  I said  Ahhh \nNoooo  \nand he realized his error and chose\n\t catchup  instead \nWe were nanoseconds away from wiping out a bunch of changes \nI guess it s the  cognitive overload  thing  that particularly hits people at 3am  that s what time\n\tit was  and both of us were tired  \nBut

only applies to outgoing changes and conflicts \nIn SN s case  it s impossible to accidently release when there s an incoming change  thus wiping out\n\tall those incoming changes \nThe only thing it could have released were conflicts \nHowever  if there were\n\tconflicts in the selection  a warning dialog would having popped up saying  You re about to overwrite stuff\n\ton the server that conflict with your changes  are you sure you want to do that   \nOnce in the catchup release view  you should think of  Catchup  and  Release  as safe operations    the\n\tonly thing they do is catchup or release non conflicting changes in whichever direction \nWhen there s a conflict \n\tit will warn you before releasing \nFor example  in the most common case you have a project with several incoming\n\tchanges and several outgoing changes  without conflicts \nYou can select the project and hit  catchup  \nThis will\n\tload just the incoming changes \nYou can then compile and test to make sure the incoming stuff did interact badly\n\twith your local stuff \nThen  select the project and hit  Release  \nThis will release only the outgoing changes \nIf the server or workbench has changed

am running it in the same JRE  but I am also running it in the \n  background simply because I don t like the modal dialog in the way every \n  time the user executes a build \nIt is not feasible from a user \n  standpoint otherwise as the build can take 8 10 seconds \n  \n  I found that doing a workspaceroot checkpoint   after my Ant build runs \n  seems to make the external tools respond and run all the time \nIs this \n  a bad thing to do \n  \n  Thanks for the reply \n  Mark \n  \n  John Arthorne wrote \n  \n   I m having trouble following your ruminations \nCould you enter a bug \n   report against Platform Resources \nIf you could provide a simple \n   builder   build xml that illustrates the problem it would greatly \n   simplify the diagnosis \n  \n   One quick thing to check is to ensure you don t have  Launch in \n   background  checked off in the Build Options tab for your Ant builder \n   Also  your Ant builder should be running in the same JRE  see the JRE \n   tab for your builder  \nRunning your Ant builder in the background or \n   in a separate JRE prevents the build manager from being able to \n   properly compute deltas and execute builders in the proper order \n   When an Ant builder runs in a separate VM  it will run in parallel \n   with other non Ant builders  meanining those internal builders will \n   not receive deltas for the work done by the Ant builder \nIf this \n   isn t your problem  please enter a bug report and we ll take it from \n   there \n      \n  \n  \n   Mark Melvin wrote \n  \n    I d like to ruminate a little more here and maybe provoke a \n    discussion on how the BuildManager works \n   \n    So I have figured some behaviour out \nThe external tool builder has \n    various options as to when it should be run \nThere are four options \n    right now \n   \n    1  After a  Clean \n    2  During manual builds\n    3  During auto builds\n    4  During a  Clean \n   \n    What I  want  to happen is  every time  my  incremental project \n    builder runs  I want to run my external tool builder to run after it \n    and regenerate a file \nI have my workspace set up to build \n    automatically \nFine  so I add my external tool builder after my \n    project builder and I check off  2 and  3  assuming that will cover \n    me \nNot so \nAs it turns out  when I change a file and an AUTO BUILD \n    occurs  it seems to work \nHowever  if I  clean  my project  the \n    platform initiates a build automatically  but this is not an  auto \n    build   it is a FULL BUILD \nThere is a difference \nEven though the \n    platform initiated the build automatically  it is not considered an \n    AUTO BUILD because the clean operation discards all build state \n   \n    OK  fine   so I guess that is why there are the other two options \n    Reading the tooltips  it says  1 executes the external tool builder \n     on the first build that occurs after a clean   and  4 executes the \n    external tool  when a clean has been initiated  \nSince I want my \n    external tool to create a file based on the output of my build  I \n    guess I want  1  not  4  \n   \n    OK  so now my external tool seems to run after my builder after a \n    clean  I can see my builder is being called automatically to do a \n    FULL BUILD after I initiate a clean    but wait \nIt only runs  some  \n    of the time \nHang on \nOK  so I can see my builder is called by the \n    platform immediately after a clean \nWhy is the external tool builder \n    not called \nIf I manually refresh the project  voila   it runs \nBut \n    why \nMy builder is actually calling refresh   on the project after \n    it finishes  and I can see the files it creates appear   but the \n    external tool is not run until I manually refresh \nWhat is going \n    on \nIt would seem to me that there is a bug here in the either the \n    BuildManager  or the external tool builder \n   \n    I would tend to think it is the BuildManager  because after I \n    manually refresh  the external tool builder runs and creates a new \n    file in my project  I have told my external tool builder to refresh \n    the project when it is done  and I can see it refresh and the file is \n    there  \nBut  this is a resource change  and should trigger my normal \n    project builder now giving it a delta to work with \nBut it doesn t \n     until  I manually refresh again \nHuh  \n   \n    Even when the external tool builder does run automatically like I \n    want it to  and creates the new file  which I can clearly see in the \n    Navigator as the external tool builder refreshes the project \n   I can \n    clearly see by putting traces in my builder code that the creation of \n    this new file does not trigger an AUTO BUILD \nHowever  if I select \n    my project and press F5  voila   I can see the platform call my \n    builder with an AUTO BUILD and the resource delta \n   \n    Why is this not happening automatically \nClearly the platform is \n    queueing up the delta  but what is causing it to not trigger the auto \n    build \nI still think it has something to do with the auto build \n    being  interrupted   but as far as I can see I have no control over \n    this \nIt is not so useful if you make a change with auto build \n    turned on  and nothing happens until the  next  time you manually \n    nudge the BuildManager \n   \n    Can anyone offer me any insight into this \nI can t seem to find \n    anything like this in Bugzilla \nHas anyone seen this sort of \n    behaviour before \n   \n    Thanks \n    mark \n   \n    Mark Melvin wrote \n   \n     I m chasing my tail trying to figure out why my external tool \n     builder is  sporadically not executed \nI have set up a project with \n     my custom builder  based on Ant  followed by an external tool \n     builder  just fires up an external  exe to create a secondary \n     file  \nI have set up the external tool builder to run as part of a \n     manual build as well as part of an auto build \nI have an action \n     that triggers a clean on my project  which causes an automatic build \n     to be triggered by Eclipse \nMy Ant builder is called as part of the \n     automatic build and does its thing  but a very large percentage of \n     the time my external tool builder is not run \nThe weird part is  it \n     may run 20 seconds  or even a minute later \nOR  if I manually \n     refresh the project  it runs \nThis is driving me nuts \nI have been \n     debugging the internal BuildManager to try to figure out what is \n     going on but I must admit I am lost \nThe best scenario I can come \n     up with is that my Ant builder is causing the auto build to be \n      interrupted  because it modifies the workspace \nBut  as I \n     understand it  this should simply tell the BuildManager to \n     re process that project later \nI can t understand why this is failing \n    \n     As a side note  one  really  weird thing is that it  always  seems \n     to work if I have no editors open  and my project selected when I do \n     a clean  which triggers the auto build  \nIf I have an editor open  \n     and nothing selected in the navigator  the external tool is almost \n     never called after my Ant builder \nIs that weird or what \nIs there \n     any sort of logic that happens depending on the
